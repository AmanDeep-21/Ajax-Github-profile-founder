# Ajax-Github-profile-founder
This finds the profile of the users when the username is entered.
This fetches the data of the user from the github api using ajax calls
and displays them to the user. This is a basic project which I have 
developed when learning web development.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/Surya-Prakash-Reddy/Ajax-Github-profile-founder.git
```
Download or clone the repo and open the index.html in any browser. Enter the user name 
of the profile you want to find in the text box and click on search.

You can see the basic details along with the profile picture. For more details about the 
user click on more
